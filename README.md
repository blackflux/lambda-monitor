Automatically configure lambda log analysis and popagation to external services.

## What it does

- Parsing and analysis of AWS Lambda Logs
- Pipes AWS Lambda Logs to external logging services (e.g. [Loggly](https://loggly.com) or [Logz](https://logz.io))
- Detects and sends AWS Lambda anomalies to external monitoring service (e.g. [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com))
- Fully transparent, no changes to existing Lambda functions required

## Requirements

- Install [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com/) with `npm install -g serverless`.
- All functions need to be tagged correctly with `STAGE` tag to be monitored (e.g. dev, qa, prod). The Serverless Framework does this automatically.

## Getting Started

Getting set up is very easy:
1) Clone repository locally with
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/simlu/lambda-monitor
```
2) Run `npm install` inside newly created `lambda-monitor` directory.
3) Update your AWS `provider.region` in `serverless.yml`.
4) Copy `config/sample.yml` to `config/STAGE.yml` for each `STAGE` (e.g. `dev`, `qa` or `prod`).
5) Configure copied files with appropriate tokens. Unused token need to be removed.
6) Run `sls deploy --stage=STAGE` for each stage.

If you decide to uninstall, simply run `sls remove --stage=STAGE`

### Configure Rollbar (Optional)

First create a new Rollbar project and call it `lambda-monitor` or similar. Now create a server write key for each stage that you are using and put it into the corresponding `STAGE.yml` file (see above).

You can configure the minimum log level that should be send to rollbar using `ROLLBAR_LOG_LEVEL`. Available options are:
`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`

To tag log messages just prefix them with, e.g. `DEBUG:`. Default log level is `WARNING`.

If you decide not to enable rollbar logging please remove the token from the appropriate yml files.

> Note: For Rollbar Logging directly from Lambda Function see [lambda-rollbar](https://github.com/simlu/lambda-rollbar).

### Configure Log Services (All Optional)

Obtain token and fill into all or corresponding `STAGE.yml`. The current stage is submitted to the logs as `env`, so you are able to easily distinguish between your stages.

If you don't want to use a service, please remove the corresponding token from the yml file.

### Disable Logging for a Lambda Function

To exclude a lambda function from being monitored simply add the tag `"MONITORED": "0"`. Note that you need to manually unsubscribe if `process-log` has already been subscribed to the CloudWatch stream.

## How it works

There are three lambda function created per stage. All operations are only performed on lambda functions tagged with the corresponding stage.

**process-logs** - This lambda function is subscribed to CloudWatch and processes the logs. Anomalies are submitted to rollbar and all detected log events are sent to the configured logging services. Tagged with `"MONITOR": "1"` and `"MONITORED": "0"`.

**subscribe** - Subscribes the *process-logs* lambda function (detected using the `MONITOR` tag) to all relevant CloudWatch Groups, excluding those functions that have the `MONITORED` tag set to `0`. 

**set-retention** - Updates the retention for all relevant CloudWatch Groups.

## Alternative Setup (More Work)

This repo is also published on npm. You can install it with `npm install --save lambda-monitor` and then use the three exposed lambda functions to your liking (note that you will need to set the environment variables correctly).

## Limitations

- Currently subscription updates happen during initial deploy and periodically. So it can take up to an hour until new lambda log streams are monitored. If you want to accelerate this you can manually execute the subscribe function.

## Contributing / What is next?

- **Publish on AWS** - [Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/) has been announced to better discover, deploy, and publish serverless applications. However this requires the "wiring" logic to be written in [SAM](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model) opposed to [Serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless). 
- **Transparent and Configurable Pipelines** - Currently all logs are processed and handled. What gets processed and submitted where should be more transparent and configurable.
- **More Services** - There are various logging and reporting services out there and adding support for more is always desired.
- **Instant Subscriptions** - Currently subscriptions are updated periodically. Ideally these would be triggered automatically when new lambda functions are deployed. There exists an [example](https://github.com/theburningmonk/lambda-logging-demo/blob/master/serverless.yml), however I was not able to get it work as intended.

*Important:* When contributing please make sure that the recorded cassettes do not expose any security relevant information. E.g. tokens need to be replaced.
